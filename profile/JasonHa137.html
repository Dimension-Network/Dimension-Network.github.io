WIP
My name is Jason Ha, and I am a student which lives in Perth, Australia. I am currently 16 years old, and in Year/Grade 10.I love to play Minecraft, as it gives me a lot of inspiration for real life. I like to build modern, but i can build in other styles as well. Minecraft has inspired me to become either an architect or an engineer as I love designing and building things.
